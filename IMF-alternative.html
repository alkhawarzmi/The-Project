					<h4>Is there an alternative to the IMF?</h4>

					<section>
						<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">IS it only the IMF?</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">Everyone is saying, it is only the IMF!</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">And in part, it is the "International Donors"</p>

					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h4>First, let us agree</h4>

					<section>
						<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">The IMF is a bank</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">The "International Donors" are governments</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">And they are not here "for us", but for the wealth of our country</p>
					</section>

					<h4>Facts!</h4>

					<section>
						<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">We need the money</p>

				<section>
					<h4>Assumptions: 2</h4>

					<section>

						<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">This means 5 millions Lebanese</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">Let us assume 10% are interested, this makes it 500,000 Lebanese</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">There are 7 Billion people on Earth! if our campaign reaches 0.2%, this makes it 14 Million</p>
