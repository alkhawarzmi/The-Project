					</section>
					<section>
						<p>We are Lebanese <em>Citizens</em>, not Politicians!</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Political Parties and Politicians of the Revolution did not attract people to rally behind them to form the "Serious Political Alternative" we are all looking for...</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>... which made people create their own "Cells"...</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>... now, there are more than 500 revolutionary cells!! <br> that we know of...</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>... some want to be a political party, and actively working for it...</p>					
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>... and the majority "wrote" of "are writing" their "Political Paper", and PLANS!...</p>					
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>... and forming or joining Political Coalitions/Fronts/Alliances...</p>					
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>... where one person is in multiple groups...</p>

					<section>
						<p>... the majority of the individuals who were active in the early days, protesting, meeting and discussing...</p>					
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>... JUST STOPPED!</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>No one is talking to them<br> No one is asking them what they want<br> No one is "LISTENING" to them!</p>

						<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">Usually, the Vision is set by a politician and/or a political party</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">Then, they start promoting it and preaching about it, to convince people to support them</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">If they reach the powers, the VISION is controlled by them</p>

						<h4>What if WE, the PEOPLE, control the VISION?</h4>
						<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">And based on Interviews with those politicians and parties.</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">WE decide who to back up, support and endorse</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">Then, our role would be a "Watchdog", moniroting and informing the community</p>

						<h4>What if WE do not find a suitable Politician or a Political Party?</h4>
